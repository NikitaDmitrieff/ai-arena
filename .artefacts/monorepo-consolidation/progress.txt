- Task 13: Create Unified Docker Compose — Done (commit 9d5090b)
  Summary: Created root docker-compose.yml with 5 services (frontend, gateway,
  tic-tac-toe, mr-white, codenames) on arena-network. Updated all Dockerfiles
  to use root build context and install arena-core from local packages/.
  Added health checks to all services. Created root .env.example with API keys.
  Created root .dockerignore. Removed arena-core from service dependency files
  (installed separately in Dockerfiles). Game services internal-only; only
  frontend (3000) and gateway (8080) exposed.

- Task 14: Visual Audit via Chrome MCP — Done (commit 0db7890)
  Summary: Performed thorough code-level visual audit of all pages and components.
  Fixes applied:
  - Added codenames to home page random game list (was missing from StartRandomButton)
  - Standardized all connection indicators to use pixel-border class (3px) across all 3 games
  - Fixed inline <code> elements to use 3px borders (was 2px) for pixel-art consistency
  - Fixed scrollbar borders in codenames EventLog and mr-white MessageFeed to 3px
  - Fixed VoteResults progress bar track border to 3px
  - Removed dead getEventColor function from codenames EventLog (was returning Tailwind classes never used)

  No dark theme remnants found. All pages use cream backgrounds, pixel-art borders, Sora font.

  manual testing steps covering:
  - Docker Compose startup and health verification
  - Gateway routing (REST and WebSocket proxy)
  - Full game flows for all 3 games (Tic-Tac-Toe, Mr. White, Codenames)
  - Exact curl commands and expected JSON responses
  - WebSocket event sequences for each game type
  - Frontend UI consistency checklist (pixel-art design system)
  - Edge cases (disconnection, no API keys, concurrent games, service down)
  - Known limitations documented

- Task 16: Publish to GitHub — Done (commit 08cffb4)
  Summary: Created README.md with project description, architecture overview,
  quick start instructions, environment variables, tech stack, and dev setup.
  Verified .gitignore covers all required patterns. Published to GitHub as
  public repo: https://github.com/NikitaDmitrieff/ai-arena

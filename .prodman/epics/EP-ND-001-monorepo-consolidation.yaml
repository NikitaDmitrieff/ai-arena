title: Monorepo Consolidation & UI Polish
status: complete
priority: p0
owner: ND
milestone: null
spec: SPEC-ND-001

description: |
  Consolidate the four AI Arena repositories (frontend + 3 game backends) into a single
  monorepo with a shared Python core library, unified API gateway, and consistent
  neo-brutalist pixel-art UI across all games. Add WebSocket support to tic-tac-toe,
  create a unified docker-compose for local development, and visually audit every page
  via Chrome MCP to ensure design consistency.

technical_scope:
  frontend:
    - Move Next.js app into apps/frontend/
    - Refactor API clients to hit single gateway instead of 3 separate backends
    - Convert Mr. White components from dark theme to pixel-art design system
    - Fix Button component and Header to use pixel-art classes
    - General animation and polish consistency pass
  backend:
    - Extract shared core library (WebSocket manager, game manager, base models, LLM integration)
    - Refactor all 3 game backends to use shared core
    - Add WebSocket support to tic-tac-toe backend
    - Create unified FastAPI gateway with route-based game dispatch
    - Unified docker-compose.yml at monorepo root

acceptance_criteria:
  structure:
    - All code lives in a single monorepo with clear directory layout
    - Shared Python package is importable by all game services
    - Single docker-compose spins up all services locally
  functionality:
    - All 3 games work end-to-end (create game, play, view results)
    - Tic-tac-toe has real-time WebSocket updates like other games
    - Frontend talks to a single API gateway URL
  visual:
    - Mr. White uses the same pixel-art design system as other games
    - Button component and Header use pixel-btn classes
    - Consistent animations and transitions across all game pages
    - Verified visually via Chrome MCP browsing
